A basic chess engine built on older [chess programming techniques](https://www.chessprogramming.org/Main_Page) instead of machine learning. The engine implements the [Universal Chess Interface](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universal_Chess_Interface) to allow it to be dropped into various front ends.

## What's with the name?

[Gladius](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gladius) comes from the Latin name for the swords used by Roman soldiers.
